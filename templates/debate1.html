            <p class="debate-passage">
                Education plays a crucial role in shaping the future of individuals and society as a whole. 
                It is often considered the key to social mobility, as it provides the skills and knowledge necessary 
                for individuals to improve their socioeconomic status. In many societies, access to quality education 
                is viewed as a fundamental right that can break the cycle of poverty. However, disparities in 
                educational opportunities often lead to unequal outcomes. For instance, children from affluent families 
                have access to better resources, experienced teachers, and enriching extracurricular activities, while 
                those from disadvantaged backgrounds face significant barriers. This debate delves into the extent to 
                which education can truly serve as a ladder for social mobility and examines the systemic issues 
                that hinder equal access to quality education.
